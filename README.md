# Assignment
Java Assignment
The project I picked for the assignment was the abusive text content detector.
I went through each project and decided that I wanted to do this project the most. 
I knew it would be a challenge but I had a fair idea how I would manage to get the program running successfully. 
I had a number of problems throughout the assignment. One of my problems when I first started the assignment 
was getting my program to print out the abusive text correctly from the file containing the abusive posts. 
When I had the abusive posts displaying successfully, I had had my main problem of getting my program to display 
the non abusive posts. I tried several different ways to get this to work. The only way I could get the non abusive 
posts to display was to add the abusive words to an array list and check if either element in the list was contained in the posts in the file. Posts which didnâ€™t contain any of the elements were the non abusive posts. 
I used words such as shut up, hate etc. I added in extras too. I added the option for the user to enter an abusive word to be checked in the file. Also if a word is contained in a post in capital letters then this will be displayed as an abusive post.
My program has three classes, a control and class that will open the file, read through it and check if the abusive
words are contained in any of the posts, and a class to display the abusive and non abusive posts.
